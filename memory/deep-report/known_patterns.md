## Known Patterns (2026-02-10)

- Copilot token usage remains concentrated in a small set of workflows; CI Failure Doctor and Chroma Issue Indexer dominate token share, while Test Dispatcher Workflow drives run volume.
- Copilot session outcomes are heavily "action_required" by design; executor-style agents show higher completion, while advisory agents remain non-autonomous.
- GitHub MCP tool response bloat persists for list_code_scanning_alerts and list_workflows; GraphQL tools (list_discussions, list_issues) remain efficient.
- Firewall reports show consistent high block rates dominated by unresolved DNS entries, with proxy.golang.org repeatedly blocked for Go-related workflows.
- Safe output pipeline health is strong with 100% success in the last 24h and no MCP/API failures.
- Copilot agent PR success rate is trending down (55% to 45% over 3 days) despite improved turnaround time.
