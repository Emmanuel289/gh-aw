## Flagged Items for Monitoring (2026-02-10)

- test-workflow.yml shows 100% failure rate (7/7) in Copilot Session Insights; urgent remediation needed.
- GitHub Remote MCP toolsets not loading in runner (auth-test), blocking GitHub MCP usage in that workflow.
- Schema consistency check found critical duplication (timeout_minutes vs timeout-minutes) and missing labels validation in compiler pipeline.
- Firewall report highlights persistent proxy.golang.org blocks for Changeset Generator; assess allowlist needs.
- Copilot agent PR success rate declining to 45% (down from 55%); monitor task scoping/quality.
